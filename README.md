## Overview
Documentation needed:
  ACI eManifest Lead Sheet with CRN - created
  PARS/InPars with CCN - created and barcode added to Mock BOL and A8A 
  A8A - created
  Commercial Invoice - Mock Commercial Invoice
  BOL - MOCK BOL
  CBSA (sometimes called SCAC) - will be using TEST
  Driver Identification - not included, this is something driver shows at border.

For this software, I will just be providing a blank Commercial Invoice and BOL.  These documents would generally come from imaging and already be filled out.  I consider creating them outside the scope of this project, and a Mock Commercial Invoice and MOCK BOL will serve the purpose to show they are included.
